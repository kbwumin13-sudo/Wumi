# Third-party notices

Wumi is an independent implementation. Project code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Third-party work retains its original copyright and license.

## 觅迹 / Miji

The file-indexing implementation adapts file-system scanning and FSEvents patterns from [Miji](https://github.com/kbwumin13-sudo/miji), including the context lifetime pattern noted in `Sources/DirDeskCore/Search/LightningEventStream.swift`.

## Oil Find

The indexing work builds on the Miji / [Oil Find](https://github.com/oil-oil/oil-find) lineage. Oil Find's notice is retained below for this upstream work. Wumi's current package does not declare an Oil Find binary or SwiftPM dependency.

## libarchive

Wumi links the macOS-provided system libarchive through a small C declaration bridge (`Sources/CArchive`). It does not bundle a copy of the libarchive binary. Upstream: https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive

The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle
and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of
this file.

Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
the actual statements in the files are controlling.

* Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
  and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
  at the bottom of this file.

* The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
  a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
  files for details:
   libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
   libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
   libarchive/mtree.5

* The following source files are in the public domain:
   libarchive/archive_parse_date.c

* The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to choose
  from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:
   libarchive/archive_blake2.h
   libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h
   libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c
   libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c

* The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
  and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
  widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
  distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
seems to be an unavoidable mess.
